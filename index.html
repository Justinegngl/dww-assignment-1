                >The global average temperature in 2020 was about 2.25 degrees
                Fahrenheit warmer than the average from 1850 to 1900, data from
                the Copernicus Climate Change Service indicates.<br /></strong
              ><br />
              Last year effectively tied 2016 as the hottest year on record,
              European climate researchers announced Friday, as global
              temperatures continued their relentless rise brought on by the
              emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.<br /><br />
              The record warmth — which fueled deadly heat waves, droughts,
              intense wildfires and other environmental disasters around the
              world in 2020 — occurred despite the development in the second
              half of the year of La Niña, a global climate phenomenon marked by
              surface cooling across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />
              And while 2020 may tie the record, all of the last six years are
              among the hottest ever, said Freja Vamborg, a senior scientist
              with the Copernicus Climate Change Service.<br /><br />
              “It’s a reminder that temperatures are changing and will continue
              to change if we don’t cut greenhouse gas emissions,” Dr. Vamborg
              said.<br /><br />
              According to Copernicus, a program of the European Union, the
              global average temperature in 2020 was 1.25 degrees Celsius (about
              2.25 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the average from 1850 to
              1900, before the rise of emissions from spreading
              industrialization. The 2020 average was very slightly lower than
              the average in 2016, too small a difference to be significant.<br /><br />
              Some regions experienced exceptional warming. For the second year
              in a row, Europe had its warmest year ever, and suffered from
              deadly heat waves. But the temperature difference between 2020 and
              2019 was striking: 2020 was 0.4 degrees Celsius, or nearly
              three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit, warmer.

                >Scientists still have to validate the reading of 130 degrees
                Fahrenheit on Sunday, the equivalent of 54 degrees Celsius.<br /></strong
              ><br />
              In the popular imagination, Death Valley in Southern California is
              the hottest place on earth. At 3:41 p.m. on Sunday, it lived up to
              that reputation when the temperature at the aptly named Furnace
              Creek reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the NOAA
              Weather Prediction center.<br /><br />
              If that reading — the equivalent of 54 degrees Celsius — is
              verified by climate scientists, a process that could take months,
              it would be the highest temperature ever reliably recorded on
              earth.<br /><br />
              Death Valley is no stranger to heat. Sitting 282 feet below sea
              level in the Mojave Desert in southeastern California near the
              Nevada border, it is the lowest, driest and hottest location in
              the United States. It is sparsely populated, with just 576
              residents, according to the most recent census.<br /><br />
              Brandi Stewart, the spokeswoman for Death Valley National Park,
              said that the valley is so hot because of the configuration of its
              lower-than-sea-level basin and surrounding mountains. The
              superheated air gets trapped in a pocket and just circulates.
              “It’s like stepping into a convection oven every day in July and
              August,” she said. <br /><br />
              So how does 130 degrees, which she walked out into on Sunday,
              feel? “It doesn’t feel that different from 125 degrees,” she said.
              “The feeling of that heat on my face, it can almost take your
              breath away.”<br /><br />
              She added that “People say, ‘Oh, but it’s a dry heat!’ I want to
              do a little bit of an eye roll there,” she said. “Humidity has its
              downsides too, but dry heat is also not fun.”<br /><br />
              She grew up in western Pennsylvania and her last posting with the
              park service was Mount Rainier National Park, one of the snowiest
              places on earth. “I’m ready for cooler temperatures,” she said.<br /><br />
              The heat rises through the afternoon, generally reaching the peak
              from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. The high on Monday was 127.<br /><br />
              Confirming a record temperature like this is not as simple as
              looking at a thermometer. There are caveats.<br /><br />
              Higher temperatures have been reported than the one recorded on
              Sunday, but many climate scientists have questioned the
              reliability of these readings.<br /><br />
              For example, Death Valley claims the record for the hottest
              temperature ever recorded in 1913, at 134 degrees. But a 2016
              analysis by the extreme weather expert Christopher Burt found that
              the reading did not align with other observations made in the
              region, concluding that it was “not possible from a meteorological
              perspective.”

                >For one reporter, documenting the destruction of redwoods and
                sequoias was a heartbreaking assignment.<br /></strong
              ><br />
              The coverage of wildfires in the West is a growing beat for
              journalists. Each year, it seems, the fires are on a mission to
              outdo the record amount of damage done the year before. Here in
              California, where rain is rare in many parts of the state from
              late spring until deep into fall, “fire season” has become a cruel
              and extended part of the calendar.<br /><br />
              When disaster is perennial, there is a natural repetition to how
              it is covered — the rising dread caused by forecasts of high
              winds, the brave rush into the scene when flames appear, the
              chaotic and frightening evacuation of people, and the aftermath of
              destruction.<br /><br />
              Like other reporters, I was constantly considering how to tackle
              familiar stories in fresh ways. Then, in August, a desert wildfire
              whipped across more than 40,000 acres in Mojave National Preserve.
              This struck me as something we had not seen before, and we hadn’t:
              More than a million Joshua trees, burned.<br /><br />
              The new superintendent at the preserve is Mike Gauthier, a veteran
              of the U.S. park service. I was first introduced to him in 2015,
              when he worked at Yosemite National Park as chief of staff and a
              liaison to climbers, and I was writing stories about two men
              climbing El Capitan’s Dawn Wall. We spoke this year just after the
              fire in the Mojave, and I had planned to get down there for a
              reporting trip.<br /><br />
              Before I could go, though, it seemed most of California was
              aflame. (In reality, it was about four million acres, or about 4
              percent of the state, that burned in 2020.) The Sierra Nevada,
              home to a shrinking number of giant sequoias, took a big brunt of
              the blazes. Then, fire rampaged through the Santa Cruz Mountains,
              and among its victims was Big Basin, the state park that is home
              to 4,400 acres of old-growth redwoods.<br /><br />
              Wait a minute, I thought. Joshua trees. Giant sequoias.
              Redwoods.<br /><br />
              Those are California’s three defining species. Each has a national
              park named after it, in different parts of the state, in entirely
              different ecosystems.<br /><br />
              All three are threatened by climate change. Now they were feeling
              the wrath of wildfire, like never before.<br /><br />
              That’s a story, I thought.
